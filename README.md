# fireworks

The function creates a random fireworks animation.

## Usage

Run the following code to install and open the package:
```
devtools::install_github("mimi329/fireworks")
library(fireworks)
```
Additionally you will need to have these two packages installed.
```
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
```

**make_art** is the main function of the package.

To understand the function run ?make_art and provide an appropriate argument to generate an animation.
```
?make_art
make_art(1234)
```

### Tip

Try inserting different numbers to see the shape of the fireworks and the distribution of the dots change.
